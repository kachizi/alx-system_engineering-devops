0x16. API Advanced Description This project focuses on advanced API handling using Python scripting for back-end development.
Background Context API-related questions are common in technical interviews, ranging from simple Python scripting tasks to more complex challenges involving recursion and data manipulation. The project encourages practice with APIs, specifically recommending the Reddit API due to its extensive endpoints and accessible information. Understanding API calls, pagination, JSON parsing, recursion, and dictionary sorting is crucial for technical interviews and personal projects alike.

Resources Reddit API Documentation Query String Learning Objectives By the end of this project, participants are expected to:

Understand how to navigate API documentation to locate endpoints Know how to handle pagination in API requests Be proficient in parsing JSON data retrieved from APIs Demonstrate the ability to make recursive API calls Learn techniques for sorting dictionaries by value Requirements Supported editors: vi, vim, emacs All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3 Files end with a new line All files begin with #!/usr/bin/python3 Libraries must be alphabetically organized Mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder Code adheres to PEP 8 style guide All files must be executable File length tested using wc Modules must have documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").doc)') Requests module must be used for HTTP requests to the Reddit API
