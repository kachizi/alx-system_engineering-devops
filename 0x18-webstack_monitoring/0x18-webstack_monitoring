0x18. Webstack monitoring DevOps SysAdmin monitoring Cohort
Monitoring Server Background Context Monitoring is crucial in the tech industry as it enables us to measure the performance of our systems. In this project, the focus is on web stack monitoring, which can be categorized into application monitoring and server monitoring. Application monitoring involves tracking the behavior of running software, while server monitoring ensures that servers are not overloaded in terms of CPU, memory, disk, or network usage.
